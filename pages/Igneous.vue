  <p>Magma is liquid rock (melt) under the Earth’s surface. Lava is melt that has erupted from a volcano at the Earth’s surface.
</p>
  <p>Magma forms when hot rock in the earth partially melts. This process occurs only under three circumstances—when the pressure decreases, when volatiles are added to hot rock. And when heat is transferred into the cast by magma rising from the mantle into the crust. 
 Magma occurs in a rang eof compositions: Felsic(silicic) intermediate, mafic and ultramafic. The composition of magma reflects the original composition of the rock from which the magma formed and the way the magma evolves.
</p>
  <p>magma rises from depth because of its buoyancy and because of pressure caused by the magma. 
 The rate at which intrusive magma cools depends on the depth at which it intrudes, the size and shape of the magma body, and whiter circulating groundwater s is present. The cooling time influences the texture of an igneous rock. 
 extrusive igneous rocks form from lava that erupts out of a volcano. Intrusive igneous rocks develop from magma the that freezes inside the Earth. 
</p>
  <p>ava may solidify to form flows. Or it may explode into the air to form ash.
 Intrusive igneous rocks form when magma intrudes into preexisting rock below Earth’s surface. Blob-shaped intrusions are called futons. Tabular intrusions that cut across layering are dikes, and those that form parallel to layering are sills. Huge intrusions, made up of many platoons,  are known as batholiths.
</p>
<p>igneous rocks are classified according to texture and composition.
</p>
<p>The origin of igneous rocks can readily be understood in the context of plate tectonics. Magma forms at continental or island volcanic arcs along convergent margins, mostly because of the additions of volatiles to the asthenosphere above the subjecting slab. Igneous rocks form at ho spots, owing to the decompression melting o f a rising maple plume. Igneous rocks form at rifts asa result of either decompression melting of the asthenosphere below the thinning lithosphere or heat transfer from mantle melts int crustal rocks. Igneous rocks form along mid-ocean ridges because  of decompression melting of the rising asthenosphere.

    <p><span>Q: </span> 1.	How is the process of freezing magma  similar to the tof freezing water? How is it different? 
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span> crystallization from magma is similar to freezing water in that crystals form from the liquid state upon passage of the liquid through a critical temperature (or range of termpartures). The most striking difference is in the temperature of crystallization. Additionally, multiple minerals crystallize from magma; more mafic minerals crystallize first, and more silicic minerals crystallize later at cooler temperatures. 
</p>
    <p><span>Q: </span>What is the source of heat in the Earth? How did the first igneous rocks on the planet form?
 </p>
    <p><span>A: </span> Earth has derived heat from collisions, gravitational compression, decay of radioactive isotopes. Meteoric bombardment, and differentiation. Eart was intintailly so hot that its surface was molten; the first igneous rocks solidified from this melt. 
</p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> Describe the three processes that are responsisible for the formation of magmas. 
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span> Descresing pressure may cause the liquid state of a mineral assemblage to be thermodynamically favored over solid crystal. b. The addition of volatiles (such as water and carbon dioxide) to a system of crystals (rock) may cause the liquid state to be thermodynamically favored. C. If a system of crystals obtains heat from a nearby source (such asa neighboring body of magma), it may melt. 
</p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> Why are there so many different types of magmas? Does partial melting produce magma with the same composition as the parent rock from which it was derived. 
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span> Magmas differ primarily with resect to chemical composition. Numerous processes can alter magmatic chemsitry and, thus, the minerals and mineral abundance’s of the crystals that ultimately freeze out of the melt. Changes in chemistry can occur through factional crystallization of melt. Partial melting of rock, and contamination through the melting and assimilation of surround host rock. In addition to the precesses that produce a chemical change, original source rocks vary. Melts also vary wit hrespect to volatile content. 
 Partial melting produces melts that are more felsic that the risk that they're partially melted. (Minerals found in more felsic rocks have lower melting points than those more mafic rocks.)
</p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> Why do magmas rise from depth to the surface of the Earth?
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span> Magmas rise because they are less dense that the rocks that surround them, and at depth, there is great pressure the squeezes magma upward, where the pressure is less. 
</p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> What factors control the viscosity of a melt?
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span> silicic melts are more viscous than mafic melts beaus silica tetrahedra mutually lit to form complex structures that cannot move as rapidly as the simple structure found in more mafic melts. High-volatile content (such as water content) lessens viscosity. Cooler magmas are more viscous that hotter magmas of the same composition. 
</p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> What facts control the cooling time of magma within the crust?
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span> magmas that cool deep within earth cool more slowly than those that cool near the surface. Large. Globular bodies of magma cool more slowly than those that are smaller and sheet-like. Cool ground water can absorb heat from magma and transport the heat away from the source, greatly increasing the cooling rate. Hot circulating groundwater can have the opposite effect.</p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> What is the difference between a sill and a dike. And how do both differ from a pluton?
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span>sills for parallel t the layered rocks into which they intrude; dikes cut across layered rocks. BOth are tabular (sheet-like) intrusions, whereas plutons are blob-shaped. 
 </p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> How does grain size reflect the cooling time of magma?</p>
    <p><span>A: </span>large, thermodynamically stable crystals from when a melt cools and crystallizes gradually. Rapidly cooling and crystallizing melts do not leave sufficient time for large crystals to become organized.  </p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> What does the picture of grain sizes in a porphyritic igneous rock indicate about its cooling history?
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span>porphyritic igneous rocks occur when an initial phase of gradual cooling with in the earth gives way to much more rapid cooling subsequent to eruption. 
 </p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> Describe the way magmas are produced in t subduction zones.
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span> Below 150km, heat causes volatiles within the subducting oceanic, lithospheric slab to be released into the ultramafic asthenosphere of the overriding plate. Partial melting of the asthenosphere produces basaltic magma, which migrates upward though the lithosphere of the overriding plate to erupt at the surface. Depending on the amount of fractional crystallization that occurs during transit, the originally basaltic mafic magma may extrude as a intermediate or a rhyolitic melt. 

</p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> What processes in the mantle may be responsible for causing hot-spot volcanoes to form?
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span>these volcanoes may form when an isolated, cylindrical plume of hot material from the lower mantle rises upward. When it reaches the lithosphere ,pressure is low enough ti initiate partial melting, forming basaltic melt from the ultramafic rock. The melt rises further to reside in a magma chamber in the crust until it erupts, forming a volcano. 
 </p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> Describe how magmas are produces at continental rifts. Why can you find both basalt and rhyolite at such settings?
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span>rifting forces thin out the lithosphere local, decreasing the pressure on the underlying asthenposhere. This pressure release triggers partial melting of ultramafic mantle rock, which yields mafic magma. If the magma rises more slowly, it will undergo magmatic evolution involving fractional crystallization ant melting of surround ing host rock. These processes make the melt more felsic. So that it might exude with rhyolitic composition.
 </p>
    <p><span>Q: </span> What is a large igneous province LIP? How might the formation of LIPS have affected the Earth System?
</p>
    <p><span>A: </span>A large igneous province is argon in the crust that contains an unusually large volume of igneous rock. The formation of such province might  have affected the earth system in a number of ways . For example, large quantities of submarine basalt might have led to the inundation of conintinest by shallow seas. These large submarine basalts might have also changed patterns of ocean circulation, which could have then altered the climate of Earth. The eruption of such large quantities  of lava  might hav exchanged the chemical composition of the atmosphere and subsequently  incurred the supply of nutrients to the ocean, bringing the about the extinction of many organisms. 
 </p>


 <p><span>Q: </span> Why does melting take place beneath the axis of a mid-ocean ridge?</p>
 <p><span>A: </span> Hot asthenosphere rises to take the place of material that has poured to either side the axis. Closer to the surface, pressure is less than at the depth from which the atmospheric material rose, so the asthenosphere partially melts.</p>
