            <p>geologists recognize four major classes of sedimentary rocks. Clastic rocks form from cemented-together grains the there first produced by weathering, then transported, deposited and lithified. Biochemical rocks develop from the shells of organisms, organic rocks consist of pant debris or od altered pklanton remains. Chemical rocks precipitate directly from water. 
</p>             
            <p>sedimentary structures include bedding, cross bedding, graded bedding, ripple marks, dunes, and mud cracks. These structures serve as clues to depositional settings. 
</p>
            <p>biochemical and organic rocks form from materials produced by living organisms. 
 limestone economists dominantly of calcite, chert forms from silica, coal from carbon, shale from clay, and sandstone from quartz grains.
</p>
            <p>evaporites consist of minerals precipitated from water. 
 glaciers, streams alluvial fans, deserts, rivers, lakes, deltas, beaches, shallow seas, and deep seas each accumulate a distinctive assemblage of sedimentary strata.

                   <p>- sediments and sedimentary rocks are rare in the crust as a whole, but they are abundant at the surface. 
</p>
                   <p>Clastic sedimentary rocks are primarily classified on the basis of calls size and shape. Students shoe be able to recognize and characterize conglomerate, breccia, sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and shale.
</p>
                   <p>Biologically mediated precipitation produces mineralized skeletons; these condense and lithify to form biochemical sedimentary rock. Important examples are most types of limestone and bedded, biogenic chert.</p>
                   <p>Organize sedimentary rocks include coal-the altered remains of trees and other plants that lived in swampy environments (which allow organic matter to accumulate without too much decay)
</p>
                   <p>Chemical sedimentary rocks arise from precipitation . As with biochemical rocks classification is primarily based on mineral content. An important subset of the are the evaporites, including rock salt (halite) and gypsum (small amounts of carbonate sediment can also form through evaporation). Chemical rocks can also from through the replacement of minerals during diagenesis.
</p>
                   <p>The layering of rock is termed stratification, or bedding; cross beds signify deposition along a slope and can also from through the replacement of minerals 
</p>
                   <p>The character of sedimentary rocks reflects their environments of deposition; students should be familiar with a few sedimentary environments for example alluvial fan, stream, shallow marine, deep marine, and glacial) as well as the characteristics of the sediments deposited in those realms. Locally, environments change over time; one source of these scavenges is the sequence of transgressions (rising local relative sea level) and regressions (falling local relate sea level)
